            <p id="stopper">But hold on just a second! <span id="cont">Before you get on with clicking and zooming about the map, we would like to give you a brief intro on the history of Canada. Don't worry, you won't have to read for too longðŸ™‚</span></p>
            <P>Canada is a seriously huge country! Measuring a massive 4,600km from the north to the south, the country covers more than half of the Northern Hemisphere.....Elsa from frozen would totally love it here. The country has a total of 6 different time zones and is the second largest country in the world, just behind Russia.</P>
            <p>The first people to have graced Canada's lands did that 15,000 to 30,000 years ago across a land bridge that connected Asia and North America. A viking guy, Leif Eriksson stumbled upon Newfoundland and tried to start a life here, but that didn't last very long....poor Eriksson. A while later, the French and British people came in to live in Canada. There were some wars between farmers and fur traders, about 4 wars between 1689 and 1763....That's a lot of fighting. The final war, called the French and Indian War, left the British people in control of Canada. In 1867, Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick united to establish a dominion equipped with its own governance system, parliamentary body, and prime minister. Manitoba became a part of this dominion shortly afterward. Canada attained its independence as a sovereign nation in 1931. After undergoing various territorial adjustments throughout its history, Canada currently comprises ten provinces and three territories.</p>
